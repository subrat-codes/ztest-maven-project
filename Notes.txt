In this example:

The name property must be a string containing only letters.
The age property must be an integer between 18 and 99.
The email property must be a valid email address.
The address property is an object with street, city, and postalCode properties. The city must contain only letters and spaces, and the postalCode must be a 5-digit number.
The score property must be a number between 0 and 100.
The valid JSON input meets all these criteria, while the invalid JSON input has several issues:

name contains numbers.
age is below the minimum value.
email is not in a valid format.
city contains numbers.
postalCode is not a 5-digit number.
score exceeds the maximum value.
